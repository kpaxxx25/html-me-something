         <h4>Sunlight</h4>
         <p>Thrives in bright to medium indirect light. Not suited for intense, direct sun but can be acclimated to withstand it.</p>
         <h4>Water</h4>

         <h4>Humidity</h4>
         <p>Normal room humidity will do, but prefers humid conditions if possible.</p>
         <h4>Temperature</h4>
         <p>65°F-85°F (18°C-30°C). It’s best not to let it go below 60°F (15°C).</p>
         <h4>Toxicity</h4>
         <p>Irritating to cats, dogs, &amp; humans only if foliage consumed.  Fruit is edible to humans.</p>

          <li>Sunlight</li>
            <ul><li> bright, indirect or diffused light to thrive, though they must be protected from the harsh rays of the direct sun. We tell people to put staghorn ferns in the brightest space in their home where, again, the plant will not take direct sun. Rooms with Southern and Eastern exposures tend to be best, though unobstructed North windows will do. Western light is fine, but be careful, as this afternoon exposure tends to be hot and harsh. </li></ul>
          <li>Water</li>
            <ul><li>Use a spray-bottle that emits a fine, ambient mist, such as a brass mister. Mist the entire plant, focusing on the underside of the antler fronds and the shield fronds
          Soak your staghorn fern in a sink or basin of water for 10-20 minutes, or until the roots are fully saturated. Alternately, hold the fern so the roots are fully submerged until fully saturated (1-2 minutes).
          Alternately, place the plaque in a sink or bathtub tap, and allow room-temperature water to run through the root ball until it is saturated. Allow your plant to drip dry before re-hanging.</li></ul>
          <li>Humidity</li>
            <ul><li>high humidity </li></ul>
          <li>Temperature</li>  
            <ul><li>surprisingly cold-hardy, but for optimal growth, the temperature should not be allowed to drop below 50 degrees or above 100 degrees.</ul></li>
          <li>Toxicity</li>
            <ul><li>non-toxic to both cat and dog </ul></li>
          <li>Other</li> 
            <ul><li>“antler” frond Spores develop on the lower these fronds, and look a bit like brown fuzz -- don’t remove the spores! 
            second type of staghorn fern frond is called the shield frond. These are the round, hard plate-like leaves that surround the base of the plant. Their function is to protect the plant roots, and take up water and nutrients. These fronds start out green, but eventually turn brown and dry up. This is a totally normal part of the staghorn fern life-cycle</li> 
            <li>can find young staghorn ferns sold in pots, mature plants need to be mounted to a board or hung in a hanging basket. Why? Because, like air plants, staghorn ferns are epiphytic plants, which means that in they grow on other plants or trees in their natural growing environments.
            shield fronds begin to creep to the edges of the plaque, standard practice is to attach your board to a larger piece of wood with a few nails</li></ul>
